# Proximo
Proximo is a proxy for multiple different publish-subscribe queuing systems.

It is based on a GRPC interface definition, making it easy to create new client libraries.
It already supports a number of popular queueing systems, and adding new ones is intended to be simple.

## Goals
* Expose multiple consumer (fan out) semantics where needed

* Minimise overhead over direct use of a given queuing system

* Allow configuration of the underlying queue system via runtime configuration of Proximo

* Allow replacement of a queueing system with no change to the Proximo client applications

* Enabling easy creation of client libraries for new languages (anything that has GRPC support)

## Non goals
* Exposing specific details of the underlying queue system via the client API

## Server

This is the Proximo server implementation, written in Go
